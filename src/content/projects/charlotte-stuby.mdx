### Insight

Swiss artist Charlotte Stuby, born in Vevey in 1989 and currently residing in Brussels, specializes in crafting **textile installations** that seamlessly blend functionality with narrative flair. Employing techniques such as "appliqu√©," quilting, embroidery, and tapestry, Stuby constructs immersive realms infused with symbols, references, and recollections drawn from both popular culture and her personal journey. Her pieces are distinguished by a dynamic color palette, drawing inspiration from heraldry and identity symbols to create captivating contrasts.

### Process

In developing [her portfolio](https://charlottestuby.com/), I opted for a visual language that mirrors her distinctive artistic style. The interface incorporates a minimal, fun, and unique aesthetic, utilizing her primary color palette as a nod to her art style. It structures its contents in an unconventional and intriguing navigation, while remaining easy to use. The goal was to create a visually impressive yet minimalistic portfolio. Utilizing Next.js and Decap CMS, I empowered Charlotte to autonomously update the content, ensuring seamless and independent control.

### Personal Role

As a freelancer, I led the design and programming of the portfolio from start to finish. Maintaining continuous communication with Charlotte, I ensured alignment with her vision, needs, and stylistic preferences. The collaborative process was smooth and friendly, resulting in a project that successfully embodies her artistic expression.
