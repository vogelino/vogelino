### Insight

The [ki.portrait Gallery](https://ki-portrait.citylab-berlin.org/) showcases a series of **AI-generated portraits** produced using DALL-E, presented at [CityLAB's](https://citylab-berlin.org/) summer fest event. Attendees had the chance to capture their portrait and leverage AI to generate distinctive artificial portraits by selecting parameters such as art style and materials. In a week-long experiment, I developed an interactive archive to document the project's progress and display its outcomes. The archive, crafted as a single-page application, was built using **Astro, TypeScript (vanilla), and WebGL**.

### Process

The goal was to craft an engaging archive showcasing the portraits and illustrating how various prompt parameters influenced the results. Opting for a 3D space, I utilized proximity to highlight similarities among portraits with shared user-selected parameters. When assigning high importance to factors like style or materials, distinct groups emerge, uniting portraits with similar artistic styles and material choices.

### Personal role

While I was away during the summer fest and not directly involved in creating the photo booth or the software interfacing with DALL-E, I enthusiastically embraced the opportunity to contribute upon learning about the team's motivation to publicly archive the successful exhibit's results. After sketching ideas and collaborating with my team, I took the initiative to bring the project to lifeâ€”overseeing everything from initial design concepts to the final lines of code.
